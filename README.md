## Technologies

- The programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) ([AdoptOpenJDK version 11.0.10](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)) was chosen for development.

- Development was carried out in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used to prototype the user interface.

- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) was used to track activity.

- [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) was used to schedule tasks.

## Development progress

Development of the project began on **Mar 10, 2021**.

Currently implemented ciphers:

- [Atbash cipher](https://github.com/VitasSalvantes/Simple-Examples#atbashcipher)
- [Caesar cipher](https://github.com/VitasSalvantes/Simple-Examples#caesarcipher)
- [Code word cipher](https://github.com/VitasSalvantes/Simple-Examples#codewordcipher)

*Since I am developing this project mainly alone, I see no reason to use [Trello](https://trello.com/).*
