        In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as
        Caesar\'s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar\'s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
        and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which
        each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down
        the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become
        B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
        correspondence.\n\n
        The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the
        plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a
        Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23
        (the shift parameter is used as the key):\n
        A -> X, B -> Y, C -> Z, D -> A, etc.\n\n
        For example:\n\n
        Input message: Hello World!\n
        Key: 1\n
        Output message: Gdkkn Vnqkc!
